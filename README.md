# 📘 EassyPass

A high-impact mobile application developed by **Vershima Kelvin Ityavyar**, designed to improve access to study materials for Computer Science students. Built using **Java**, **Android SDK**, **Room DB**, and **Firebase**, the app enables students to easily browse, search, and download past exam questions for offline study.

> 🚀 Reached over **1,000+ downloads in the first month**, organically within the department—solving a real academic challenge with scalable software.

I built this app to solve a specific problem my department faced—poor access to past questions—by designing and implementing a solution that is not only technically sound but also widely adopted by students.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Identify user needs through direct observation and feedback
- Build production-ready apps from scratch
- Work with local storage and cloud integrations
- Deliver clean, testable, and maintainable code
- Design with performance and UX in mind
